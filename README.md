# Pdf-component-library

This is forked from https://github.com/allenai/pdf-component-library.
I have edited the repository to:

* remove the parts we won't use
* add scripts for processing PDFs (finding bounding box locations of passages
  that we want to highlight)
* simplify the reader based on the original demo
* add in some instructions for how to launch and build the UI demo
